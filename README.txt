How it works


You need to install this plugin either through the wp-admin dashboard, or by uploading it to your host
through FTP. This is freely available at the Wordpress.org repository

Upon installation, go to the settings icon on your wordpress admin dashboard and locate 'Limit cart options'

Click to open the settings page. Here specify the maximum number of vendors/items per every order.
The default values are 50 vendors and 10,000 items per order.
The setting is global.

Once you set these, that's it. Enjoy
